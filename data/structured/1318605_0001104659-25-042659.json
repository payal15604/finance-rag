    "content": "EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION Compensation Discussion and Analysis The following discussion and analysis of compensation arrangements of our named executive officers for 2024 should be read together with the compensation tables and related disclosures set forth below. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on our current considerations, expectations and determinations regarding future compensation programs. The actual amount and form of compensation and the compensation programs that we adopt may differ materially from current or planned programs as summarized in this discussion. The following discussion and analysis relates to the compensation arrangements for 2024 of (i) our principal executive officer, (ii) our principal financial officer, (iii) the most highly compensated person, other than our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, who was serving as executive officer at the end of our fiscal year ended December 31, 2024 and (iv) our former Senior Vice President, Powertrain and Energy Engineering, who served in such capacity during part of 2024 (our \u201cnamed executive officers\u201d). We had no other executive officers serving at the end of our fiscal year ended December 31, 2024. Our named executive officers for fiscal year 2024 were: Name Position Elon Musk Technoking of Tesla and Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Taneja Chief Financial Officer Tom Zhu Senior Vice President, APAC Andrew Baglino Former Senior Vice President, Powertrain and Energy Engineering Mr. Baglino departed Tesla in April 2024. Overview and Fiscal Year 2024 Company Highlights Our current executive compensation program, which was developed and approved by the Compensation Committee, generally consists of base salary and equity-based incentives, as well as other benefits generally available to employees. We combine these elements in order to formulate compensation packages with the goal of providing, on a total basis, competitive pay and aligning the interests of our named executive officers with long-term shareholder interests by tying the value of their compensation to our long-term stock price and/or the achievement of financial, operational and strategic objectives. In 2024, Tesla\u2019s full-year accomplishments under our executive leadership included the following: \u00b7 Model Y was the best-selling vehicle, of any kind, globally for the full year 2024; \u00b7 Reached lowest average cost of goods per vehicle ever at less than $35,000; \u00b7 31.4 gigawatt hours of energy storage, representing an increase of 113.3%, compared to the prior year, and the completion of construction of Megafactory Shanghai; and 5 \u00b7 Further improvements and deployment of our FSD (Supervised) capabilities, including through increased AI training compute by over 400% in 2024 and the introduction of our purpose-built Robotaxi product, Cybercab. Compensation Philosophy Our mission is to accelerate the world\u2019s transition to sustainable energy. This is a long-term mission, and our compensation programs reflect this \u2014 and our startup origins \u2014 in that they consist primarily of salary or wages and equity awards. Whereas salary or wages are intended to meet our employees\u2019 near-term liquidity needs, we believe that equity awards are an effective tool for retaining employees long-term, as they vest incrementally over a period of time or upon the achievement of specified performance milestones intended to be achieved over the medium- and long-term. During periods in which our stock price and the underlying value of equity awards increase, their retention impact is even greater. We believe that the potential for such increases also creates an ownership culture that promotes holding equity, which in turn aligns the interests of our employees with the long-term interests of our shareholders. Additionally, this compensation philosophy further allows our employees to grow their skill sets and contributions consistent with our long-term mission. For these reasons, our goal is to provide each employee with the opportunity to participate in our equity programs, with certain cash-based bonus programs serving generally to accommodate specific incentive structures or liquidity needs. In light of these considerations, we generally do not make annual grants of equity awards to our senior executives, including our named executive officers , and instead grant equity awards from time to time based upon individual roles and contributions and the retentive impact of currently outstanding equity awards. By combining salary or wages and our equity award program, we strive to offer a total level of compensation that is competitive within specific roles and geographical markets. In particular, we believe that compensation for the individuals who are responsible for Tesla\u2019s strategic direction and operations should motivate them to achieve sustainable shareholder value and/or tangible milestones rather than to simply remain at Tesla or maintain the status quo. Therefore, while we offer to our general employee population restricted stock units that will retain some value even if the market value of our stock decreases, when grants are made to executive officers those grants generally comprise stock option awards, which have zero initial value and accumulate value, if at all, only to the extent that our stock price increases following their grant, through the applicable vesting dates and until such stock options are ultimately exercised and the underlying shares are sold. In addition, because equity awards comprise a greater proportion of our executive officers\u2019 total level of compensation compared to comparable roles at peer companies, a sustained decrease in our stock price or failure to achieve the applicable operational milestones may result in a level of total compensation that is significantly less than that of such peer roles. Likewise, our outside director compensation program has been comprised primarily of equity awards that are entirely in the form of stock option awards, as well as relatively modest cash retainer payments that may be waived at the election of each director. Each director determined to forego all cash retainer payments in 2024. We evaluate our compensation philosophy and programs regularly and evolve them as circumstances merit with oversight by the Compensation Committee, particularly with respect to executive and director compensation. For example, if our stock price experiences significant movement over a short period of time that results in a persistent change to equity compensation, certain adjustments may be considered to align our compensation programs to their intended purposes. In 2024, we reviewed our compensation programs with respect to our senior executives to align our compensation programs to their intended purposes, including striving to offer a total level of compensation that reflects individual performance to be competitive within specific roles and geographical markets and to provide appropriate retentive impact in light of currently outstanding equity awards. Following this review, in October 2024, the Compensation Committee, in consultation with its compensation consultant and our Chief Executive Officer, adjusted base salaries and/or granted equity awards to certain senior executives, which included Mr. Taneja, one of our named executive officers, whose compensation had not been adjusted since he was promoted to the role of Chief Financial Officer in August 2023, as described below. Additionally, the Company\u2019s Board of Directors has established a Special Committee to consider certain compensation matters involving Mr. Musk. Key Factors in Determining Executive Compensation Role of Compensation Committee in Executive Compensation The Compensation Committee has overall responsibility for recommending to the Board the compensation of our Chief Executive Officer and reviewing and determining the compensation of our other executive officers. Members of the Compensation Committee are appointed by the Board. Currently, the Compensation Committee consists of three members of the Board: Ira Ehrenpreis (Chair), Robyn Denholm and Kathleen Wilson-Thompson, none of whom is an executive officer of Tesla, and each of whom qualifies as an \u201cindependent director\u201d under the Nasdaq Stock Market Rules and is deemed independent under all applicable requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission and Tesla\u2019s Corporate Governance Guidelines, which follow the Nasdaq framework for the determination of independence. 6 Role of Compensation Consultants The Compensation Committee has the authority to engage, and has from time to time engaged, the services of outside consultants to assist in making decisions regarding the establishment of Tesla\u2019s compensation philosophy and programs, including for executives and directors. In 2024, Compensia, Inc., a national consulting firm (\u201cCompensia\u201d) was retained as a compensation consultant to advise the Compensation Committee with respect to Tesla\u2019s executive compensation program. Role of Executive Officers in Compensation Decisions Historically, for executive officers other than our Chief Executive Officer, the Compensation Committee has sought and considered input from our Chief Executive Officer regarding such executive officers\u2019 responsibilities, performance and compensation. Specifically, our Chief Executive Officer recommends base salary increases and equity award levels for our senior personnel, and advises the Compensation Committee regarding the compensation program\u2019s ability to attract, retain and motivate executive talent. These recommendations reflect compensation levels that our Chief Executive Officer believes are qualitatively commensurate with an executive officer\u2019s individual qualifications, experience, responsibility level, functional role, knowledge, skills and individual performance, as well as Tesla\u2019s performance. The Compensation Committee considers our Chief Executive Officer\u2019s recommendations, but ultimately determines compensation in its judgment and approves the compensation for all of our executive officers (other than for our Chief Executive Officer, the compensation for whom is recommended by the Compensation Committee to, and ultimately approved by, the Board). The Compensation Committee meets regularly in executive session. Our Chief Executive Officer is not present during Compensation Committee deliberations or votes on his compensation and also recuses himself from sessions of the Board where the Board acts on the Compensation Committee\u2019s recommendations regarding his compensation. In addition, the Board has established a management committee under the Tesla, Inc. 2019 Equity Incentive Plan (the \u201cEquity Award Committee\u201d) to grant and administer equity awards, subject to certain limitations, such as, among other things, maximum limits on the seniority of personnel to whom the Equity Award Committee may grant awards and the value of any individual award. For example, the Equity Award Committee is not authorized to grant awards to employees at or above the level of vice president. Moreover, pursuant to applicable law, the Equity Award Committee may not grant awards to its members, and the number of shares of our common stock underlying awards granted by it may not exceed amounts determined by the Board from time to time. The Board has delegated to the Compensation Committee oversight authority over the Equity Award Committee. Role of Shareholder Say-on-Pay Votes At our 2024 annual meeting, our shareholders overwhelmingly approved the compensation of our named executive officers, with approximately 79% of our shareholders present and entitled to vote at the meeting voting in favor of our compensation policies for our named executive officers. Given these results, the Compensation Committee has decided to retain our overall approach to executive compensation while continuing to evaluate our practices. At the 2023 annual meeting of shareholders, our shareholders indicated a preference for an annual shareholder advisory vote on the compensation of our named executive officers. Consistent with the results of the shareholder vote, we intend to hold a shareholder advisory vote on executive compensation every year until the next vote on the frequency of shareholder advisory votes on executive compensation. We are required to hold a \u201csay on frequency\u201d vote at least every six years regarding how often to hold a shareholder advisory vote on the compensation of our named executive officers. Clawback Policy We maintain a clawback policy for compliance with the Nasdaq listing standards and Section 10D of the Exchange Act. This clawback policy applies to current and former executive officers in the event that the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement due to the material noncompliance of the Company with any financial reporting requirement under securities laws; misconduct on the part of the executive is not required. Under this clawback policy, we are required to recoup incentive-based compensation (as that term is defined in Section 10D of the Exchange Act) erroneously received within the three completed fiscal years immediately preceding the date on which we are required to prepare an accounting restatement. 7 Our Corporate Governance Guidelines also sets forth a compensation recovery (\u201cclawback\u201d) policy with respect to our executive officers. Moreover, the terms of the performance-based stock option award granted to Elon Musk in January 2018 (the \u201c2018 CEO Performance Award\u201d) include a clawback provision in the event of a restatement of our financial statements previously filed with the SEC.

    "content": "reported in Tesla\u2019s financial statements on Forms 10-Q or 10-K filed with the SEC for the previous four consecutive fiscal quarters. Any single operational milestone could only satisfy the vesting requirement of one tranche, together with the corresponding market capitalization milestone. Subject to any applicable clawback provisions, policies or other forfeiture terms, once a milestone was achieved, it was forever deemed achieved for purposes of determining the vesting of a tranche. Meeting more than 12 of the 16 operational milestones does not result in any additional vesting or other compensation to Mr. Musk under the 2018 CEO Performance Award. Except in a change in control situation, measurement of the market capitalization milestones was based on both (i) a six calendar month trailing average of Tesla\u2019s stock price as well as (ii) a 30 calendar day trailing average of Tesla\u2019s stock price, in each case based on trading days only. Upon the consummation of certain acquisitions or split-up, spin-off or divestiture transactions, each then-unachieved market capitalization milestone and/or operational milestone would have been adjusted to offset the impact of such transactions to the extent they had been considered material to the achievement of those milestones. In establishing the Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA milestones, the Board carefully considered a variety of factors, including Tesla\u2019s growth trajectory and internal growth plans and the historical performance of other high-growth and high-multiples companies in the technology space that have invested in new businesses and tangible assets. These benchmarks provided revenue/EBITDA to market capitalization multiples, which were then used to inform the specific operational targets that aligned with Tesla\u2019s plans for future growth. Nevertheless, the Board considered each of the market capitalization and operational milestones to be challenging hurdles. For example, in order to meet all 12 market capitalization milestones, Tesla was required to add approximately $600 billion to its market capitalization at the time of the grant of the 2018 CEO Performance Award on a sustained basis, and in order to satisfy all eight revenue-based operational milestones, Tesla would have to increase revenue by more than $163 billion from its annual revenue of approximately $11.8 billion in 2017, the last fiscal year completed prior to the grant of the 2018 CEO Performance Award. 11 In addition, Mr. Musk was required to continue leading Tesla as our Chief Executive Officer or, alternatively, as our Chief Product Officer and Executive Chairman (with any other Chief Executive Officer reporting directly to him), at the time each milestone is met in order for the corresponding tranche to vest. With limited exceptions, Mr. Musk must hold any shares that he acquires upon exercise of the 2018 CEO Performance Award for at least five years post-exercise. There would have been no acceleration of vesting of the 2018 CEO Performance award upon Mr. Musk\u2019s termination, death or disability or a change in control of Tesla. However, in a change in control situation, the achievement of the milestones would have been based solely on the market capitalization milestones, with the measurement of Tesla\u2019s market capitalization determined by the product of the total number of outstanding shares of Tesla common stock immediately before the change in control multiplied by the greater of the last closing price of a share of Tesla common stock before the effective time of the change in control or the per share price (plus the per share value of any other consideration) received by Tesla\u2019s shareholders in the change in control. In the event of a restatement of Tesla\u2019s financial statements previously filed with the SEC, if a lesser portion of the 2018 CEO Performance Award would have vested based on the restated financial results, then Tesla will require forfeiture (or repayment, as applicable) of the portion of the 2018 CEO Performance Award that would not have vested based on the restated financial results (less any amounts Mr. Musk may have paid to Tesla in exercising any forfeited awards). The 2018 CEO Performance Award is subject, if more stringent than the foregoing, to any current or future Tesla clawback policy applicable to equity awards, provided that the policy does not discriminate solely against Mr. Musk except as required by applicable law. As of the date of this filing, all of the milestones have been achieved and certified by our Board. Consequently, all 12 of the 12 tranches under the 2018 CEO Performance Award, corresponding to options to purchase an aggregate 303,960,630 shares of Tesla\u2019s common stock, have vested and become exercisable, subject to Mr. Musk\u2019s payment of the exercise price of $23.34 per share and the minimum five-year holding period generally applicable to any shares he acquires upon exercise.

    "content": "of Regulation S-K. Under the RPT Policy, the Audit Committee must review and approve all transactions in which (i) Tesla or one of its subsidiaries is a participant, (ii) the amount involved exceeds $120,000 and (iii) a related person has a direct or indirect material interest, other than transactions available to all Tesla employees generally. In assessing a related person transaction brought before it for approval the Audit Committee considers, among other factors, whether the related person transaction is on terms no less favorable than terms generally available to an unaffiliated third-party under the same or similar circumstances and the extent of the related person\u2019s interest in the transaction. The Audit Committee may then approve or disapprove the transaction in its discretion, or may request additional information. Related person transactions will be disclosed in the applicable SEC filing as required by the rules of the SEC. Related Person Transactions Elon Musk is an executive officer, director and/or significant shareholder of SpaceX, X, xAI and TBC. In March 2025, xAI and X effected a transaction under which xAI and X became wholly-owned subsidiaries of a new parent company named X.AI Holdings Corp. SpaceX is party to certain commercial, licensing and support agreements with Tesla. Under these agreements, SpaceX incurred expenses of approximately $2.4 million in 2024 and approximately $0.1 million through February 2025. Since April 2016, SpaceX has invoiced Tesla for our use of an aircraft owned and operated by SpaceX at rates determined by Tesla and SpaceX, subject to rules of the Federal Aviation Administration governing such arrangements. Tesla incurred expenses of approximately $0.8 million in 2024 and approximately $0.04 million through February 2025. X is party to certain commercial, consulting and support agreements with Tesla. Under these agreements, Tesla incurred expenses of approximately $0.1 million in 2024. As part of a multi-platform advertising campaign, Tesla also directly or indirectly purchased advertising on X, which totaled approximately $0.4 million in 2024 and approximately $0.01 million through February 2025. xAI is party to certain commercial (including those for the purchase of Megapacks), consulting and support agreements with Tesla. Under these agreements, xAI incurred expenses of approximately $198.3 million in 2024 and approximately $36.9 million through February 2025. Approximately $191.0 million during 2024 and $36.8 million through February 2025 was incurred by xAI for its purchase of our Megapack products. TBC is party to commercial agreements with Tesla. Under these agreements, Tesla incurred expenses of approximately $3.6 million in 2024 and approximately $0.8 million through February 2025. We are party to a service agreement with a security company, owned by Elon Musk and organized to provide security services concerning him, including in connection with his duties to and work for Tesla. Tesla incurred expenses of approximately $2.8 million for such security services in 2024 and approximately $0.5 million through February 2025, representing a portion of the total cost of security services concerning Elon Musk. JB Straubel is the Chief Executive Officer of Redwood. Tesla is party to an agreement with Redwood to supply certain scrap materials. Under this agreement, Redwood incurred expenses of approximately $30.3 million in 2024 and approximately $0.6 million through February 2025. Kimbal Musk is the Chief Executive Officer of Nova Sky Stories. In 2024, we entered into a commercial agreement with Nova Sky Stories in relation to the production of an aerial show. Under this agreement, Tesla incurred expenses of approximately $0.3 million in 2024. Other Transactions Tesla periodically does business with certain entities its directors are affiliated with. Such transactions are done on terms no less favorable than terms generally available to an unaffiliated third-party under the same or similar circumstances. 24 In the ordinary course of business, we enter into offer letters with our executive officers. We have also entered into indemnification agreements with each of our directors and officers. The indemnification agreements and our certificate of formation and bylaws require us to indemnify our directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. In relation to our CEO\u2019s exercise of stock options and sale of common stock from the 2012 CEO Performance Award, Tesla withheld the appropriate amount of taxes. However, given the significant amounts involved, our CEO entered into an indemnification agreement with us in November 2021 to indemnify the Company for additional taxes owed, if any. Director Independence The Board periodically assesses, with the recommendation of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, the independence of its members as defined in the listing standards of Nasdaq and applicable law. The Board undertook an analysis for each director and director nominee and considered all relevant facts and circumstances, including the director\u2019s other commercial, accounting, legal, banking, consulting, charitable and familial relationships. The Board determined that with respect to each of its current members and director nominees, other than Elon Musk, who is our Chief Executive Officer, and Kimbal Musk, who is Elon Musk\u2019s brother, there are no disqualifying factors with respect to director independence enumerated in the listing standards of Nasdaq or any relationships that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director, and that each such member is an \u201cindependent director\u201d as defined in the listing standards of Nasdaq and applicable laws. In particular, the Board reviewed the following considerations: \u00b7 Ira Ehrenpreis, Joe Gebbia, James Murdoch, Elon Musk, Kimbal Musk and JB Straubel and/or investment funds affiliated with them, have made minority investments in certain companies or investment funds (i) of which other Tesla directors are founders, significant shareholders, directors, officers, or managers, and/or (ii) with which Tesla has had certain relationships, such as those set forth in \u201c Related Person Transactions \u201d under this"
