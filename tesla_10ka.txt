on a total basis, competitive pay and aligning the interests of our named executive officers with long-term shareholder interests by tying
the value of their compensation to our long-term stock price and/or the achievement of financial, operational and strategic objectives.
In 2024, Tesla’s full-year accomplishments under our executive leadership included the following:
·
Model Y was the best-selling vehicle, of any kind, globally for the full year 2024;
·
Reached lowest average cost of goods per vehicle ever at less than $35,000;
·
31.4 gigawatt hours of energy storage, representing an increase of 113.3%, compared to the prior year, and the completion of
construction of Megafactory Shanghai; and
5
·
Further improvements and deployment of our FSD (Supervised) capabilities, including through increased AI training compute by over
400% in 2024 and the introduction of our purpose-built Robotaxi product, Cybercab.
Compensation Philosophy
Our mission is to accelerate the world’s
transition to sustainable energy. This is a long-term mission, and our compensation programs reflect this — and our startup
origins — in that they consist primarily of salary or wages and equity awards. Whereas salary or wages are intended to meet
our employees’ near-term liquidity needs, we believe that equity awards are an effective tool for retaining employees long-term,
as they vest incrementally over a period of time or upon the achievement of specified performance milestones intended to be achieved over
the medium- and long-term. During periods in which our stock price and the underlying value of equity awards increase, their retention
impact is even greater. We believe that the potential for such increases also creates an ownership culture that promotes holding equity,
which in turn aligns the interests of our employees with the long-term interests of our shareholders. Additionally, this compensation
philosophy further allows our employees to grow their skill sets and contributions consistent with our long-term mission. For these reasons,
our goal is to provide each employee with the opportunity to participate in our equity programs, with certain cash-based bonus programs
serving generally to accommodate specific incentive structures or liquidity needs. In light of these considerations, we generally do not
make annual grants of equity awards to our senior executives, including our named executive officers
, and instead grant equity
awards from time to time based upon individual roles and contributions and the retentive impact of currently outstanding equity awards.
By combining salary or wages and our equity award program, we strive to offer a total level of compensation that is competitive within
specific roles and geographical markets.
In particular, we believe that compensation for
the individuals who are responsible for Tesla’s strategic direction and operations should motivate them to achieve sustainable shareholder
value and/or tangible milestones rather than to simply remain at Tesla or maintain the status quo. Therefore, while we offer to our general
employee population restricted stock units that will retain some value even if the market value of our stock decreases, when grants are
made to executive officers those grants generally comprise stock option awards, which have zero initial value and accumulate value,
if at all, only to the extent that our stock price increases following their grant, through the applicable vesting dates and until such
stock options are ultimately exercised and the underlying shares are sold. In addition, because equity awards comprise a greater proportion
of our executive officers’ total level of compensation compared to comparable roles at peer companies, a sustained decrease in our
stock price or failure to achieve the applicable operational milestones may result in a level of total compensation that is significantly
less than that of such peer roles. Likewise, our outside director compensation program has been comprised primarily of equity awards that
are entirely in the form of stock option awards, as well as relatively modest cash retainer payments that may be waived at the election
of each director. Each director determined to forego all cash retainer payments in 2024.
We evaluate our compensation philosophy and programs
regularly and evolve them as circumstances merit with oversight by the Compensation Committee, particularly with respect to executive
and director compensation. For example, if our stock price experiences significant movement over a short period of time that results in
a persistent change to equity compensation, certain adjustments may be considered to align our compensation programs to their intended
purposes.
In
2024, we reviewed our compensation programs with respect to our senior executives to align our compensation programs to their intended
purposes, including striving to offer a total level of compensation that reflects individual performance to be competitive within specific
roles and geographical markets and to provide appropriate retentive impact in light of currently outstanding equity awards. Following
this review, in October 2024, the Compensation Committee, in consultation with its compensation consultant and our Chief Executive
Officer, adjusted base salaries and/or granted equity awards to certain senior executives, which included Mr. Taneja, one of our named
executive officers, whose compensation had not been adjusted since he was promoted to the role of Chief Financial Officer in August 2023,
as described below.
Additionally, the Company’s Board of Directors has established a Special Committee to consider certain compensation matters involving
Mr. Musk.
Key Factors in Determining Executive Compensation
Role of Compensation Committee in Executive Compensation
The Compensation Committee has overall responsibility
for recommending to the Board the compensation of our Chief Executive Officer and reviewing and determining the compensation of our other
executive officers. Members of the Compensation Committee are appointed by the Board. Currently, the Compensation Committee consists of
three members of the Board: Ira Ehrenpreis (Chair), Robyn Denholm and Kathleen Wilson-Thompson, none of whom is an executive officer of
Tesla, and each of whom qualifies as an “independent director” under the Nasdaq Stock Market Rules and is deemed
independent under all applicable requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission and Tesla’s Corporate Governance Guidelines,
which follow the Nasdaq framework for the determination of independence.
6
Role of Compensation Consultants
The Compensation Committee has the authority to
engage, and has from time to time engaged, the services of outside consultants to assist in making decisions regarding the establishment
of Tesla’s compensation philosophy and programs, including for executives and directors. In 2024, Compensia, Inc., a national
consulting firm (“Compensia”) was retained as a compensation consultant to advise the Compensation Committee with respect
to Tesla’s executive compensation program.
Role of Executive Officers in Compensation Decisions
Historically, for executive officers other than
our Chief Executive Officer, the Compensation Committee has sought and considered input from our Chief Executive Officer regarding such
executive officers’ responsibilities, performance and compensation. Specifically, our Chief Executive Officer recommends base salary
increases and equity award levels for our senior personnel, and advises the Compensation Committee regarding the compensation program’s
ability to attract, retain and motivate executive talent. These recommendations reflect compensation levels that our Chief Executive Officer
believes are qualitatively commensurate with an executive officer’s individual qualifications, experience, responsibility level,
functional role, knowledge, skills and individual performance, as well as Tesla’s performance. The Compensation Committee considers
our Chief Executive Officer’s recommendations, but ultimately determines compensation in its judgment and approves the compensation
for all of our executive officers (other than for our Chief Executive Officer, the compensation for whom is recommended by the Compensation
Committee to, and ultimately approved by, the Board).
The Compensation Committee meets regularly in executive
session. Our Chief Executive Officer is not present during Compensation Committee deliberations or votes on his compensation and also
recuses himself from sessions of the Board where the Board acts on the Compensation Committee’s recommendations regarding his compensation.
In addition, the Board has established a management committee under the Tesla, Inc. 2019 Equity Incentive Plan (the “Equity
Award Committee”) to grant and administer equity awards, subject to certain
limitations, such as, among other things, maximum limits on the seniority of personnel to whom the Equity Award Committee may grant awards
and the value of any individual award. For example, the Equity Award Committee is not authorized to grant awards to employees at or above
the level of vice president. Moreover, pursuant to applicable law, the Equity Award Committee may not grant awards to its members, and
the number of shares of our common stock underlying awards granted by it may not exceed amounts determined by the Board from time to time.
The Board has delegated to the Compensation Committee oversight authority over the Equity Award Committee.
Role of Shareholder Say-on-Pay Votes
At our 2024 annual meeting, our shareholders overwhelmingly
approved the compensation of our named executive officers, with approximately 79% of our shareholders present and entitled to vote at
the meeting voting in favor of our compensation policies for our named executive officers. Given these results, the Compensation Committee
has decided to retain our overall approach to executive compensation while continuing to evaluate our practices.
At the 2023 annual meeting of shareholders, our
shareholders indicated a preference for an annual shareholder advisory vote on the compensation of our named executive officers. Consistent
with the results of the shareholder vote, we intend to hold a shareholder advisory vote on executive compensation every year until the
next vote on the frequency of shareholder advisory votes on executive compensation. We are required to hold a “say on frequency”
vote at least every six years regarding how often to hold a shareholder advisory vote on the compensation of our named executive officers.
Clawback Policy
We maintain a clawback policy for compliance with
the Nasdaq listing standards and Section 10D of the Exchange Act. This clawback policy applies to current and former executive officers
in the event that the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement due to the material noncompliance of the Company with any
financial reporting requirement under securities laws; misconduct on the part of the executive is not required. Under this clawback policy,
we are required to recoup incentive-based compensation (as that term is defined in Section 10D of the Exchange Act) erroneously received
within the three completed fiscal years immediately preceding the date on which we are required to prepare an accounting restatement.
7
Our Corporate Governance Guidelines also sets forth
a compensation recovery (“clawback”) policy with respect to our executive officers. Moreover, the terms of the performance-based
stock option award granted to Elon Musk in January 2018 (the “2018 CEO Performance Award”) include a clawback provision
in the event of a restatement of our financial statements previously filed with the SEC. See “
Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Chief
Executive Officer Compensation—2018 CEO Performance Award
” under this Item 11 below.
Current Elements of Named Executive Officer Compensation
Base Salary
The Compensation Committee is responsible for reviewing
our Chief Executive Officer’s and other executive officers’ base salaries. The base salaries of all executive officers are
reviewed and adjusted when necessary to reflect individual roles, performance and the competitive market. Because we currently do not
provide cash bonuses to our executive officers, salary is the primary cash-based element of our executive officers’ compensation
structure.
In connection with the 2024 review of our compensation programs discussed
in “
Compensation Philosophy
” above, the Compensation Committee increased Mr. Taneja’s base salary to reflect
his promotion in August 2023 to the role of Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Zhu’s base salary decreased in 2024 as compared to
2023 due to certain geographic considerations that arose in 2023 when he was on assignment from Gigafactory Shanghai. The following table
sets forth information regarding the annualized base salary rates at the end of 2024 for our named executive officers:

(2)
Mr. Musk historically earned a base salary that reflected the applicable minimum wage requirements under California law,
and he was subject to income taxes based on such base salary. However, he has never accepted his salary. Commencing in May 2019
at Mr. Musk’s request, we eliminated altogether the earning and accrual of this base salary.
(3)
Mr. Baglino departed Tesla in April 2024. His annualized base salary rate at his time of departure was $300,000.
Equity-Based Incentives
Our equity award program is the primary vehicle for offering long-term
incentives to our named executive officers. The equity awards we have historically granted and currently grant are options to purchase
shares of our common stock and restricted stock unit awards that are settled in shares of our common stock upon vesting. We have granted
to our named executive officers both awards that vest over a long-term period and awards that vest only upon the achievement of specified
Tesla performance milestones, in each case subject to continued service. We emphasize the grant of stock option awards for our named executive
officers, which have value only to the extent, if any, that our stock price increases following their grant. Accordingly, since 2020,
equity awards granted to our named executive officers have primarily been in the form of stock options: Mr. Zhu, our Senior Vice
President, APAC, received 100% of his equity award as stock options upon his promotion to such role in 2023, and Mr. Taneja,
our Chief Financial Officer, received approximately 80% of his equity award as stock options in 2024, following the 2024 review of our
compensation programs discussed in
“Compensation Philosophy
” above and in consideration of his promotion in August
2023 to the role of Chief Financial Officer. As a result, a significant portion of our named executive officers’ total compensation
is entirely at risk, depending on long-term stock price performance.
8
While we strive to offer a total level of compensation
that is competitive within specific roles and geographical markets, we do not have a rigid set of criteria for granting equity awards;
instead, the Compensation Committee exercises its judgment and discretion, in consultation with our Chief Executive Officer and from time
to time, a compensation consultant (other than with respect to decisions pertaining to the Chief Executive Officer’s compensation).
To determine the form and amount of equity awards previously granted to named executive officers, the Compensation Committee considers,
among other things, the role and responsibility of the named executive officer, competitive market factors, equity awards previously granted
to the named executive officer, the impact of any dramatic changes in our stock price over a short period of time and the cash-based compensation
received by the named executive officer. We generally grant one-time new hire equity awards to our employees, including executives, upon
their commencement of employment with us, or upon their promotion to a new position. Additionally, as part of our ongoing executive compensation
review and alignment process, we have periodically granted additional equity awards to our executives.
The Compensation Committee granted an equity award to Mr. Taneja
in October 2024, following the 2024 review of our compensation programs discussed in “
Compensation Philosophy
”
above and considering his promotion in August 2023 to the role of Chief Financial Officer. Approximately 80% of Mr. Taneja’s
equity award was granted as stock options and 20% of the award was granted as restricted stock units. See “
Grants of Plan-Based
Awards in 2024
” and “
Executive Compensation— Outstanding Equity Awards at 2024 Fiscal Year-End
” under
this Item 11 below for a description of the equity awards granted to Mr. Taneja. The Compensation Committee did not grant any equity
awards in 2024 to our other named executive officers, including our Chief Executive Officer.
The Compensation Committee meets
periodically, including to approve equity award grants to our executives from time to time. We do not have, nor do we plan to
establish, any program, plan or practice to time equity award grants in coordination with releasing material non-public information,
and the Compensation Committee does not take material non-public information into account when determining the timing and terms of
equity awards. Tesla has not timed the disclosure of material non-public information to affect the value of executive compensation.
During 2024, there were no stock options granted to any named executive officer within four business days preceding, or within one
business day after, the filing of any report on Forms 10-K, 10-Q or 8-K that discloses material non-public information.
Severance and Change in Control Benefits
No named executive officer has a severance or change
in control arrangement with Tesla.
Bonus
We do not currently have or have planned, and historically
we have rarely entered into, any specific arrangements with our named executive officers providing for cash-based bonus awards.
Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation
We did not provide any non-equity incentive plan
compensation to any of our named executive officers in 2024, and we do not currently have or have planned any specific arrangements
with our named executive officers providing for non-equity incentive plan compensation.
Perquisites
Generally, we do not provide any perquisites or
other personal benefits to our named executive officers which are not offered on a non-discriminatory basis to all employees as well.
Health and Welfare Benefits
We provide the following benefits to our named
executive officers on the same basis provided to all of our employees:
·
medical insurance including comprehensive transgender and fertility coverage, mental health, dental and vision;
·
adoption and surrogacy benefits;
9
·
confidential Employee Assistance Program counseling;
·
life insurance and accidental death and dismemberment insurance;
·
a Section 401(k) plan where Tesla will provide a company match equal to 50% of the employee’s contribution, up to
a maximum of 3% of the employee’s eligible compensation with a $3,000 annual cap;
·
an employee stock purchase plan;
·
short-and long-term disability insurance;
·
medical and dependent care flexible spending account; and
·
a health savings account.
Chief Executive Officer Compensation
Overview
Historically, in developing compensation recommendations
for our Chief Executive Officer, the Compensation Committee has sought both to appropriately reward our Chief Executive Officer’s
previous and current contributions and to create incentives for our Chief Executive Officer to continue to contribute significantly to
successful results in the future. Each of the 2018 CEO Performance Award and the performance-based stock option award granted to our Chief
Executive Officer in August 2012 (the “2012 CEO Performance Award”) was focused on this latter objective, as it solely
rewards future performance.
In addition to serving as our Chief Executive Officer
since October 2008, Elon Musk has contributed significantly and actively to us since our earliest days in April 2004 by
recruiting executives and engineers, contributing to vehicle engineering and design, raising capital for us, bringing investors to us
and raising our public awareness.
Cash Compensation
Mr. Musk historically earned a base salary
that reflected the applicable minimum wage requirements under California law, and he was subject to income taxes based on such base salary.
However, he has never accepted his salary. Commencing in May 2019 at Mr. Musk’s request, we eliminated altogether
the earning and accrual of this base salary.
Historical Equity Compensation
Prior to the stock option awards granted in December 2009,
Mr. Musk did not receive any equity compensation for his services for a period of five years.
In 2010 and 2011, Mr. Musk did not receive
any equity grants, because the Compensation Committee believed his grants made in December 2009 already provided sufficient motivation
for Mr. Musk to perform his duties as Chief Executive Officer.
In August 2012, to create incentives for continued
long-term success from the then-recently launched Model S program as well as from Tesla’s then-planned Model X and Model 3 programs,
and to further align executive compensation with increases in shareholder value, the Board granted to Mr. Musk the 2012 CEO Performance
Award, comprised of a stock option award to purchase 79,123,515 shares (as adjusted for the 2020 Stock Split and 2022 Stock Split) of
Tesla’s common stock, representing 5% of Tesla’s total issued and outstanding shares at the time of grant. The 2012 CEO Performance
Award consisted of 10 equal vesting tranches, each requiring that Tesla meet a combination of (i) the achievement of a specified
operational milestone relating to development of Model X or Model 3, aggregate vehicle production or a gross margin target, and (ii) a
sustained incremental $4 billion increase in Tesla’s market capitalization from $3.2 billion, Tesla’s market capitalization
at the time of grant. Prior to its expiration in 2022, the market capitalization conditions for all of the 10 vesting tranches and nine
of the 10 operational milestones had been achieved, and nine of 10 tranches under the 2012 CEO Performance Award vested.
10
Prior to 2018, the only additional equity awards
received by Mr. Musk related to certain immaterial awards granted during 2013 pursuant to a patent incentive program that was available
to our employees generally.
2018 CEO Performance Award
Early in 2017, with the 2012 CEO Performance Award
heading to substantial completion after having helped Tesla grow its market capitalization to over $55 billion in just over five years,
the independent members of the Board began preliminary discussions regarding how to continue to incentivize Mr. Musk to lead Tesla
through the next phase of its development. In January 2018, following more than six months of careful analysis and development
led by the Compensation Committee, with participation by every independent Board member, the help of Compensia and engagement with and
feedback from our largest institutional shareholders, the Board granted the 2018 CEO Performance Award to Mr. Musk. Such grant was
subject to approval by a majority of the total votes of Tesla common stock not owned by Mr. Musk or Kimbal Musk cast at a meeting
of the shareholders to approve the 2018 CEO Performance Award. On March 21, 2018, such approval was obtained, with approximately
73% of the votes cast by such disinterested shares voting in favor of the 2018 CEO Performance Award.
The 2018 CEO Performance Award was comprised of
a 10-year maximum term stock option to purchase 303,960,630 shares (as adjusted for the 2020 Stock Split and 2022 Stock Split) of Tesla’s
common stock, divided equally among 12 separate tranches that were each equivalent to 1% of the issued and outstanding shares of Tesla’s
common stock at the time of grant, at an exercise price of $23.34 per share (as adjusted for the 2020 Stock Split and 2022 Stock Split).
Each of the 12 tranches of the 2018 CEO Performance Award vested upon certification by the Board that both (i) the market capitalization
milestone for such tranche, which began at $100 billion for the first tranche and increased by increments of $50 billion thereafter and
(ii) any one of the following eight operational milestones focused on revenue or eight operational milestones focused on profitability,
was met:
Total Revenue*

$6.0
$100.0
$8.0
$125.0

$14.0
*            “Revenue”
means total revenues as reported in Tesla’s financial statements on Forms 10-Q or 10-K filed with the SEC for the previous four
consecutive fiscal quarters.
**          “Adjusted
EBITDA” means (i) net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders before (ii) interest expense, (iii) (benefit)
provision for income taxes, (iv) depreciation and amortization, and (v) stock-based compensation, as each such item is reported
in Tesla’s financial statements on Forms 10-Q or 10-K filed with the SEC for the previous four consecutive fiscal quarters.
Any single operational milestone could only satisfy
the vesting requirement of one tranche, together with the corresponding market capitalization milestone. Subject to any applicable clawback
provisions, policies or other forfeiture terms, once a milestone was achieved, it was forever deemed achieved for purposes of determining
the vesting of a tranche. Meeting more than 12 of the 16 operational milestones does not result in any additional vesting or other compensation
to Mr. Musk under the 2018 CEO Performance Award. Except in a change in control situation, measurement of the market capitalization
milestones was based on both (i) a six calendar month trailing average of Tesla’s stock price as well as (ii) a 30
calendar day trailing average of Tesla’s stock price, in each case based on trading days only. Upon the consummation of certain
acquisitions or split-up, spin-off or divestiture transactions, each then-unachieved market capitalization milestone and/or operational
milestone would have been adjusted to offset the impact of such transactions to the extent they had been considered material to the achievement
of those milestones.
In establishing the Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA
milestones, the Board carefully considered a variety of factors, including Tesla’s growth trajectory and internal growth plans and
the historical performance of other high-growth and high-multiples companies in the technology space that have invested in new businesses
and tangible assets. These benchmarks provided revenue/EBITDA to market capitalization multiples, which were then used to inform the specific
operational targets that aligned with Tesla’s plans for future growth. Nevertheless, the Board considered each of the market capitalization
and operational milestones to be challenging hurdles. For example, in order to meet all 12 market capitalization milestones, Tesla was
required to add approximately $600 billion to its market capitalization at the time of the grant of the 2018 CEO Performance Award on
a sustained basis, and in order to satisfy all eight revenue-based operational milestones, Tesla would have to increase revenue by more
than $163 billion from its annual revenue of approximately $11.8 billion in 2017, the last fiscal year completed prior to the grant
of the 2018 CEO Performance Award.
11
In addition, Mr. Musk was required to continue
leading Tesla as our Chief Executive Officer or, alternatively, as our Chief Product Officer and Executive Chairman (with any other Chief
Executive Officer reporting directly to him), at the time each milestone is met in order for the corresponding tranche to vest. With limited
exceptions, Mr. Musk must hold any shares that he acquires upon exercise of the 2018 CEO Performance Award for at least five years
post-exercise. There would have been no acceleration of vesting of the 2018 CEO Performance award upon Mr. Musk’s termination,
death or disability or a change in control of Tesla. However, in a change in control situation, the achievement of the milestones would
have been based solely on the market capitalization milestones, with the measurement of Tesla’s market capitalization determined
by the product of the total number of outstanding shares of Tesla common stock immediately before the change in control multiplied by
the greater of the last closing price of a share of Tesla common stock before the effective time of the change in control or the per share
price (plus the per share value of any other consideration) received by Tesla’s shareholders in the change in control.
In the event of a restatement of Tesla’s
financial statements previously filed with the SEC, if a lesser portion of the 2018 CEO Performance Award would have vested based on the
restated financial results, then Tesla will require forfeiture (or repayment, as applicable) of the portion of the 2018 CEO Performance
Award that would not have vested based on the restated financial results (less any amounts Mr. Musk may have paid to Tesla in exercising
any forfeited awards). The 2018 CEO Performance Award is subject, if more stringent than the foregoing, to any current or future Tesla
clawback policy applicable to equity awards, provided that the policy does not discriminate solely against Mr. Musk except as required
by applicable law.
As of the date of this filing, all of the milestones
have been achieved and certified by our Board. Consequently, all 12 of the 12 tranches under the 2018 CEO Performance Award, corresponding
to options to purchase an aggregate 303,960,630 shares of Tesla’s common stock, have vested and become exercisable, subject to Mr. Musk’s
payment of the exercise price of $23.34 per share and the minimum five-year holding period generally applicable to any shares he acquires
upon exercise.
Realized Compensation
For purposes of the table in “
Summary
Compensation Table
” under this Item 11 below, we are required to report pursuant to applicable SEC rules any stock
option grants to Mr. Musk at values determined as of their respective grant dates and which are driven by certain assumptions prescribed
by Financial Accounting Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718, “
Compensation–Stock Compensation
”
(“ASC Topic 718”). Moreover, we are required to report in “
Pay Ratio Disclosure
” under this Item 11
below (i) Mr. Musk’s annual total compensation, (ii) the median of the annual total compensation of all Tesla employees
qualifying for this analysis, other than Mr. Musk, in each case calculated pursuant to the methodology used for the table under “
Summary
Compensation Table,
” and (iii) the ratio of the former to the latter.
In addition, we are required to report in “
2024
Option Exercises and Stock Vested
” under this Item 11 below an amount for the “value realized” upon: (i) any
exercise by Mr. Musk of a stock option, which is based on the difference between the market price of the underlying shares at the
time of exercise and the exercise price of the stock option, and (ii) any vesting of a restricted stock unit award, based on the
market price of the award at the time of vesting. Such amount is required to be reported even if Mr. Musk does not actually receive
any cash from such exercise or vesting, either because he does not also sell any shares or because he sells only a number of shares sufficient
to cover the related tax liabilities resulting from the exercise or vesting.
As a result, there may be a significant disconnect
between what is reported as compensation for Mr. Musk in a given year in such sections and the value actually realized as compensation
in that year or over a period of time. Moreover, the vast majority of compensation in respect of past stock option grants to Mr. Musk,
including the 2012 CEO Performance Award and the 2018 CEO Performance Award, were structured to be incentives for
future
performance
with their value realizable only if Tesla’s stock price appreciated compared to the dates of the grants, and if the Company achieved
applicable vesting requirements.
12
To supplement the disclosures in “
Summary
Compensation Table,
” “
Pay Ratio Disclosure
” and “
2024 Option Exercises and Stock Vested
”
under this Item 11 below, we have included the following table, which shows the total realized compensation of Mr. Musk for
the last three fiscal years, as well as the ratio of Mr. Musk’s realized compensation to the median of the annual total
compensation of all other Tesla employees qualifying for this analysis as reported under “
Pay Ratio Disclosure.
” Realized
compensation is not a substitute for reported compensation in evaluating our compensation structure, but we believe that realized compensation
is an important factor in understanding that the value of compensation that Mr. Musk ultimately realizes is dependent on a number
of additional factors, including: (i) the vesting of certain of his option awards only upon the successful achievement of a number
of market capitalization increase and operational milestone targets; (ii) the fact that Mr. Musk does not receive any cash if
he does not actually sell shares and thereby reduce his investment in us, and he does not receive any cash to the extent that he sells
only shares sufficient to cover income taxes with respect to his awards (including stock options exercised solely to avoid their expiration
in accordance with their terms); and (iii) the then-current market value of our common stock at the times at which Mr. Musk
may elect to actually sell his shares.

Tax and Accounting Considerations
Sections
280G and 409A
. We have not provided or committed to provide any executive officer or director with a gross-up or other reimbursement
for tax amounts the executive might pay pursuant to Section 280G or Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Tax
Code”). Section 280G and related Tax Code sections provide that executive officers, directors who hold significant shareholder
interests and certain other service providers could be subject to significant additional excise taxes if they receive payments or benefits
in connection with a change in control of Tesla that exceeds certain limits, and that we or our successor could lose a deduction on the
amounts subject to the additional tax. Section 409A also imposes additional significant taxes on the individual in the event that
an executive officer, director or service provider of certain types receives “deferred compensation” that does not meet the
requirements of Section 409A.
Tax
Deduction Limit
. Section 162(m) of the Tax Code generally disallows a tax deduction to public corporations for compensation
greater than $1,000,000 paid in any fiscal year to certain executive officers. The Compensation Committee has not adopted a formal
policy regarding tax deductibility of compensation paid to our executive officers and reserves the right to pay compensation that may
not be deductible to Tesla if it determines that doing so would be in the best interests of Tesla.
13
Accounting
Implications
. We follow ASC Topic 718 for our stock-based compensation awards. ASC Topic 718 requires companies to measure
the compensation expense for all stock-based compensation awards made to employees and directors based on the grant date “fair value”
of these awards. This calculation is performed for accounting purposes and reported in the compensation tables below, even though our
named executive officers may never realize any value from their awards. ASC Topic 718 also requires companies to recognize the compensation
cost of their stock-based compensation awards in their income statements over the period that an executive officer is required to render
service in exchange for the option or other award.
Other Information
On June 4, 2018, a Tesla shareholder
filed a shareholder derivative complaint in the Delaware Court of Chancery against Mr. Musk and certain current and former
Tesla directors in connection with the Tesla Board’s approval of the 2018 CEO Performance Award. On January 30, 2024, the
Court issued a post-trial opinion that granted the plaintiff’s request that the 2018 CEO Performance Award be fully rescinded.
In addition, following the recommendation of a special committee of the Board, the Board (with Mr. Musk and Kimbal Musk
recusing themselves) determined that the ratification of the 2018 CEO Performance Award was in the best interests of the Company and
its shareholders, approved the ratification (the “Ratification”) of the 2018 Performance Award, directed that the
Ratification be submitted to the shareholders at the 2024 annual meeting, and recommended that shareholders approve the
Ratification. The Ratification was approved by the shareholders at the 2024 annual meeting. Following the Ratification, Tesla
requested that the Delaware Court revise its decision to rescind the 2018 CEO Performance Award. On December 2, 2024, the
Delaware Court rejected the request to revise its decision. On December 13, 2024, the Delaware Court entered a final judgment
rescinding the 2018 CEO Performance Award. Tesla is appealing the Delaware Court’s decision to not recognize the Ratification,
its decision to reject the request to revise its decision, and  its judgment rescinding the 2018 CEO Performance Award. The
current and former Tesla directors are also appealing the Delaware Court’s post-trial decision.
Compensation Committee Report
The Compensation Committee oversees Tesla’s
compensation programs, policies and practices. The Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis
required by Item 402(b) of Regulation S-K with management. Based on such review and discussions, the Compensation Committee
has recommended to the Board that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this Amendment.

Includes Mr. Baglino’s exercise, in connection with his departure from Tesla in April 2024, of
                                                                             all of his remaining vested options within the period required by the terms and conditions of the applicable award for
                                                                             post-termination exercise.
Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control
We do not have an employment agreement for
any specific term with any of our named executive officers. Moreover, we do not have any contract, agreement, plan or arrangement
that would result in payments to a named executive officer at, following, or in connection with any termination of employment,
including resignation, severance, retirement or a constructive termination of employment of a named executive officer, or a change
in control of Tesla or a change in the named executive officer’s responsibilities.
Pay Ratio Disclosure
Tesla is committed to fair and competitive compensation
for our employees. Moreover, Elon Musk, the Technoking of Tesla and our Chief Executive Officer, has agreed to a compensation arrangement
in the 2018 CEO Performance Award that is substantially tied to the appreciation of our market capitalization. Because equity awards are
generally made available to Tesla employees, this also means that Mr. Musk’s compensation is tied to the success of Tesla employees.
We are providing a ratio of (i) Mr. Musk’s 2024 annual total compensation to (ii) the median of the 2024 annual total
compensation of all applicable qualifying Tesla employees other than Mr. Musk, in each case calculated pursuant to the disclosure
requirements of “
Summary Compensation Table
” above. As we continue our expansion, the median annual total compensation
of our employees reflects differences in local compensation scales and practices.
17
Mr. Musk’s 2024 annual total compensation,
as reported under “
Summary Compensation Table
,” was $0, and the median 2024 annual total compensation of all other
qualifying employees, as determined pursuant to the methodology set forth below, was $57,243. Consequently, the applicable ratio of such
amounts for 2024 was 0.00:1.
Our methodology for identifying the median of the
2024 annual total compensation for each individual other than Mr. Musk was as follows:
·
We selected December 31, 2024, which is within the last three months of 2024, as the date upon which we would identify the
 “median employee” because it enabled us to make such identification in a reasonably efficient and economical manner.
·
We determined that as of December 31, 2024, Tesla and all our subsidiaries had 126,507 individuals qualifying for this analysis
(full-time, part-time and temporary employees other than Mr. Musk, subject to the following bullet), of which approximately 43% were
based outside of the U.S. and approximately 37% were production line employees.
·
We did not include in the population of qualifying individuals any employees of staffing agencies whose compensation is determined
by such agencies.
·
We applied the requirements and assumptions required for the table under “
Summary Compensation Table
” above for
each of such individuals to calculate the total annual compensation, including base salary or wages, performance-based commission payments,
and equity awards based on their grant date fair values.
·
We converted any payment earned or paid in a foreign currency to U.S. dollars using the average of the prevailing conversion rates
for the month of December 2024.
·
We selected the median of all total annual compensation amounts calculated in accordance with the foregoing.
Employee Risks
The Compensation Committee oversees management
of risks relating to Tesla’s compensation plans and programs. Tesla’s management and the Compensation Committee have assessed
the risks associated with Tesla’s compensation policies and practices for all employees, including non-executive officers. These
include risks relating to setting ambitious targets for our employees’ compensation or the vesting of their equity awards and our
emphasis on at-risk equity-based compensation, and the potential impact of such practices on the retention or decision-making of our employees,
particularly our senior management. Based on the results of this assessment, Tesla does not believe that its compensation policies and
practices for all employees, including non-executive officers, create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect
on Tesla.
Compensation of Directors
2024 Director Compensation Table
The following table provides information concerning
the compensation paid by us to each of our non-employee directors who served during any part of fiscal year 2024. Elon Musk, who
is a named executive officer, does not receive additional compensation for his services as a director.
18
The awards with respect to which values are provided
under the column “Option Awards” below are exclusively stock options, which have realizable value only if they vest over time
and to the extent, if any, that our stock price exceeds the applicable exercise prices. The values provided below for these awards are
based on applicable accounting standards, and do not necessarily reflect the actual amounts realized or realizable pursuant to the underlying
stock options.

                                            stock option grants for service on the Board or as members or chairs of Board committees
                                            that were automatically granted pursuant to the Director Compensation Policy. In June 2021,
                                            the Board unanimously adopted a resolution to forego any automatic grants of annual stock
                                            option awards under the Director Compensation Policy or otherwise previously approved by
                                            the Board (the “Board Stock Option Grants”) until July 2022 unless the Board
                                            earlier acts to amend the Director Compensation Policy or otherwise amends such resolution.
                                            In May 2022, the Board agreed to further forego the Board Stock Options Grants until
                                            the Board earlier acts to amend the Director Compensation Policy or otherwise amends such
                                            resolution. Under the Stipulation and Agreement of Compromise and Settlement (the “Detroit
                                            Settlement Agreement”) in connection with a derivative action brought by a purported

                                            Wilson-Thompson will also permanently forego any compensation for Board service for 2023.
                                            See
“Other Information”
below for additional information regarding
                                            the Detroit Settlement Agreement.
(4)
In connection with the Detroit Settlement Agreement, certain current or former directors have agreed to, among other things, return to
Tesla certain unexercised options, totaling 1,957,861, that were awarded as compensation from 2017 to 2020 (the “Returned
Options”). Tesla expects to implement the provisions of the Detroit Settlement Agreement in May 2025 by cancelling the Returned
Options. Once the Returned Options are cancelled, the number of authorized shares under the Tesla, Inc. 2019 Equity Incentive Plan will
be increased by the number of Returned Options. The Returned Options are included in this table.
19
Overview and Philosophy
The compensation program for Tesla’s non-employee
directors is designed to be consistent with our compensation philosophy for our employees, with an emphasis on equity-based compensation
over cash in order to align the value of their compensation with the market value of our stock, and consequently, with the long-term interests
of our shareholders. Moreover, while we offer to our general employee population restricted stock units that will retain some value even
if the market value of our stock decreases, the equity-based compensation to our directors has been exclusively in the form of stock options,
which have zero initial value and accumulate value, if at all, only to the extent that our stock price increases following their grant,
through the applicable vesting dates and until such stock options are ultimately exercised and the underlying shares are sold. The remaining
portion of our directors’ compensation has consisted of cash retainer payments that are relatively modest compared to peer companies
and that may be waived at the election of each director. Consequently, a large portion and in some cases, the entirety, of each of our
non-employee directors’ compensation is entirely at risk, and fluctuating stock prices have at times resulted in 100% of the vested
stock options then held by each of our non-employee directors being out-of-the-money.
In 2020 and 2021, the Compensation Committee reviewed
the Director Compensation Policy with the aid of Compensia and in light of Tesla’s exceptional performance and commitment to at-risk
director compensation in the form of annual stock option awards to ensure continued alignment of the interests of directors with those
of Tesla’s shareholders. Following such review, the Compensation Committee recommended that the Board approve a resolution that
all existing directors forego any automatic grants of annual stock option awards under the Director Compensation Policy or otherwise previously
approved by the Board until July 2022 unless the Board earlier acts to amend the Director Compensation Policy or otherwise amends
such resolution. In June 2021, the Board unanimously approved and adopted this resolution and in May 2022, the Board agreed
to further forego the Board Stock Option Grants until the Board earlier acts to amend the Director Compensation Policy or otherwise amends
such resolution. The Compensation Committee intends to make further recommendations with respect to the Board’s compensation program
for directors, if any, who join the Board after the date of this resolution, as well as for future periods of service by existing directors,
following further periodic reviews.
Other Information
If, following a change in control of Tesla, the
service of a non-employee director is terminated, all stock options granted to the director shall fully vest and become immediately exercisable.
Non-employee directors may also have their travel,
lodging and related expenses associated with attending Board or Board committee meetings reimbursed by Tesla.
On June 17, 2020, a purported Tesla stockholder
filed a derivative action in the Delaware Court of Chancery, purportedly on behalf of Tesla, against certain of Tesla’s current
and former directors regarding compensation awards granted to Tesla’s directors, other than Elon Musk, between 2017 and 2020. The
suit asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment and seeks declaratory and injunctive relief, unspecified damages
and other relief. Defendants filed their answer on September 17, 2020.
On July 14, 2023, the parties filed a Stipulation
and Agreement of Compromise and Settlement, which does not involve an admission of any wrongdoing by any party. Pursuant to the terms
of the agreement, Tesla provided notice of the proposed settlement to stockholders of record as of July 14, 2023. The Court held a hearing
regarding the settlement on October 13, 2023, after which it took the settlement and plaintiff counsels’ fee request under advisement.
On January 8, 2025, the Court approved the settlement and awarded Plaintiff’s counsel fees in the amount of approximately $176 million.
A final judgment was entered by the Court on January 13, 2025.
The Company disagrees with the amount of
attorneys’ fees awarded by the court. On February 10, 2025, Tesla appealed the attorneys’ fee award amount to the
Delaware Supreme Court. Tesla did not appeal the Delaware Court of Chancery’s approval of the underlying settlement. Also on
February 10, 2025, a single shareholder appealed the approval of the settlement. This shareholder’s appeal does not seek to
alter any material terms (e.g., financial contributions or the defendants’ obligations under the Detroit Settlement
Agreement). The Delaware Court of Chancery had previously rejected this shareholder’s objections when approving the Detroit
Settlement Agreement.
Because neither Tesla’s appeal nor the
shareholder’s appeal seeks to vacate the Detroit Settlement Agreement or materially modify its terms, the Company expects to
implement the provisions of the Detroit Settlement Agreement in May 2025 by cancelling the options requiring cancellation under its
terms. The settlement is not expected to have an adverse impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position.
Pledging of Shares
The ability of our directors and executive officers
to pledge Tesla stock for personal loans and investments is inherently related to their compensation due to our use of equity awards and
promotion of long-termism and an ownership culture. Moreover, providing these individuals flexibility in financial planning without having
to rely on the sale of shares aligns their interests with those of our shareholders.
In order to mitigate the risk of forced sales of
pledged shares, the Board has a policy that limits pledging of Tesla stock by our directors and executive officers. Pursuant to this policy,
directors and executive officers may pledge their stock (exclusive of options, warrants, restricted stock units or other rights to purchase
stock) as collateral for loans and investments, provided that the maximum aggregate loan or investment amount collateralized by such pledged
stock does not exceed, (i) with respect to our CEO, the lesser of $3.5 billion or twenty-five percent (25%) of the total value
of the pledged stock, or (ii) with respect to our directors and officers other than our CEO, fifteen percent (15%) of the total
value of the pledged stock.
20
Example: A director (other than our CEO) pledges 1,000
shares as collateral for a loan, and the current stock price is $800 per share. The director may borrow up to 15% of 1,000 x $800, or
$120,000, against such shares. If the stock price later increases to $1,600 per share, the director may borrow up to an additional $120,000
against the pledged shares. If the director borrows the full allowable amount of $240,000 and the stock price then decreases to $1,200,
the director must repay $60,000 to maintain compliance with the 15% limit under the pledging policy.
See “
Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial
Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters—Ownership of Securities
” under Item 12 below for information
regarding any shares pledged by our directors or executive officers as of December 31, 2024; however, such pledging does
not
indicate the extent to which there may be actual borrowings against such shares as of such date, which may be substantially
less than the value of the shares pledged. As of December 31, 2024, based on written representations of our directors and executive
officers to the Company, the aggregate loan or investment amount collateralized by our directors and executive officers’ pledged
shares was less than 1% of the total value of the pledged shares.
We require our directors and executive officers
to make written representations, at least annually, that he or she is in compliance with our pledging policy. If a director or executive
officer wishes to take a loan collateralized by pledged stock, Tesla management works with the director or executive officer during the
original loan approval, and subsequently monitors compliance with this policy by regularly reviewing and requesting updates from the applicable
director or executive officer on his or her pledged stock amount and loan amount. If necessary, Tesla management will report to the Board
or its committees the extent to which any officer or director has pledged shares of Company stock. We believe that this monitoring is
effective and includes appropriate controls, and we have confirmed that each of our directors and executive officers who have pledged
stock are and have been compliant with this policy since our last confirmation.
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation
Robyn Denholm, Ira Ehrenpreis and
Kathleen Wilson-Thompson served as members of the Compensation Committee during 2024. None of such persons is or was formerly an officer
or an employee of Tesla. See “
Certain Relationships and Related Person Transactions and Director Independence—Related Person
Transactions”
under Item 13 below for certain transactions involving Tesla in which members of the Compensation Committee
may potentially be deemed to have an indirect interest.
During 2024, no interlocking relationships existed
between any member of Tesla’s Board or Compensation Committee and any member of the board of directors or compensation committee
of any other company.

Ownership of Securities
The following table sets forth certain information
regarding the beneficial ownership of Tesla’s common stock, as of December 31, 2024, for the following:
·
each person (or group of affiliated persons) who is known by us to beneficially own 5% of the outstanding shares of our common stock;
·
each of our non-employee directors;
·
each of our current executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table in Item 11 above; and
·
all current directors and executive officers of Tesla as a group.
In computing the number of shares of common stock
beneficially owned by a person and the percentage ownership of that person, we deemed to be outstanding all shares of common stock
subject to options or other convertible securities held by that person or entity that are currently exercisable or exercisable within
60 days of December 31, 2024. We did not deem these shares outstanding, however, for the purpose of computing the percentage
ownership of any other person. Applicable percentage ownership is based on 3,216,138,890 shares of Tesla’s common stock outstanding
at December 31, 2024.

ITEM 13.     CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS
AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE
Review of Related Person Transactions
In accordance with the charter for the Audit Committee
of the Board and our written Policies and Procedures with Respect to Related Person Transactions (“RPT Policy”), our Audit
Committee reviews and approves any related person transactions.
For purposes of these procedures, “related
person” and “transaction” have the meanings contained in Item 404 of Regulation S-K.
Under the RPT Policy, the Audit Committee must
review and approve all transactions in which (i) Tesla or one of its subsidiaries is a participant, (ii) the amount involved
exceeds $120,000 and (iii) a related person has a direct or indirect material interest, other than transactions available to all
Tesla employees generally.
In assessing a related person transaction brought
before it for approval the Audit Committee considers, among other factors, whether the related person transaction is on terms no less
favorable than terms generally available to an unaffiliated third-party under the same or similar circumstances and the extent of the
related person’s interest in the transaction. The Audit Committee may then approve or disapprove the transaction in its discretion,
or may request additional information.
Related person transactions will be disclosed in
the applicable SEC filing as required by the rules of the SEC.
Related Person Transactions
Elon Musk is an executive officer, director and/or
significant shareholder of SpaceX, X, xAI and TBC. In March 2025, xAI and X  effected a transaction under which xAI and X  became wholly-owned
subsidiaries of a new parent company named X.AI Holdings Corp.
SpaceX is party to certain commercial, licensing
and support agreements with Tesla. Under these agreements, SpaceX incurred expenses of approximately $2.4 million in 2024 and approximately
$0.1 million through February 2025.
Since April 2016, SpaceX has invoiced Tesla
for our use of an aircraft owned and operated by SpaceX at rates determined by Tesla and SpaceX, subject to rules of the Federal
Aviation Administration governing such arrangements. Tesla incurred expenses of approximately $0.8 million in 2024 and approximately
$0.04  million through February 2025.
X is party to certain commercial, consulting and
support agreements with Tesla. Under these agreements, Tesla incurred expenses of approximately $0.1 million in 2024. As part of a multi-platform
advertising campaign, Tesla also directly or indirectly purchased advertising on X, which totaled approximately $0.4 million in 2024
and approximately $0.01 million through February 2025.
xAI is party to certain commercial (including those
for the purchase of Megapacks), consulting and support agreements with Tesla. Under these agreements, xAI incurred expenses of approximately
$198.3 million in 2024 and approximately $36.9  million through February 2025. Approximately $191.0 million during 2024 and $36.8 million through February 2025 was incurred by xAI for its purchase of our  Megapack products.
TBC is party to commercial agreements with Tesla.
Under these agreements, Tesla incurred expenses of approximately $3.6 million in 2024 and approximately $0.8 million through February
2025.
We are party to a service agreement with a security
company, owned by Elon Musk and organized to provide security services concerning him, including in connection with his duties to and
work for Tesla. Tesla incurred expenses of approximately $2.8 million for such security services in 2024 and approximately $0.5 million
through February 2025, representing a portion of the total cost of security services concerning Elon Musk.
JB Straubel is the Chief Executive Officer of Redwood.
Tesla is party to an agreement with Redwood to supply certain scrap materials. Under this agreement, Redwood incurred expenses of approximately
$30.3 million in 2024 and approximately $0.6  million through February 2025.
Kimbal Musk is the Chief Executive Officer of Nova
Sky Stories. In 2024, we entered into a commercial agreement with Nova Sky Stories in relation to the production of an aerial show. Under
this agreement, Tesla incurred expenses of approximately $0.3 million in 2024.
Other Transactions
Tesla periodically does business with certain entities
its directors are affiliated with. Such transactions are done on terms no less favorable than terms generally available to an unaffiliated
third-party under the same or similar circumstances.
24
In the ordinary course of business, we enter into
offer letters with our executive officers. We have also entered into indemnification agreements with each of our directors and officers.
The indemnification agreements and our certificate of formation and bylaws require us to indemnify our directors and officers to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable law. In relation to our CEO’s exercise of stock options and sale of common stock from the 2012 CEO
Performance Award, Tesla withheld the appropriate amount of taxes. However, given the significant amounts involved, our CEO entered into
an indemnification agreement with us in November 2021 to indemnify the Company for additional taxes owed, if any.
Director Independence
The Board periodically assesses, with the recommendation
of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, the independence of its members as defined in the listing standards of Nasdaq and
applicable law. The Board undertook an analysis for each director and director nominee and considered all relevant facts and circumstances,
including the director’s other commercial, accounting, legal, banking, consulting, charitable and familial relationships. The Board
determined that with respect to each of its current members and director nominees, other than Elon Musk, who is our Chief Executive Officer,
and Kimbal Musk, who is Elon Musk’s brother, there are no disqualifying factors with respect to director independence enumerated
in the listing standards of Nasdaq or any relationships that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out
the responsibilities of a director, and that each such member is an “independent director” as defined in the listing standards
of Nasdaq and applicable laws.
In particular, the Board reviewed the following
considerations:
·
Ira Ehrenpreis, Joe Gebbia, James Murdoch, Elon Musk, Kimbal Musk and JB Straubel and/or investment funds affiliated with them, have
made minority investments in certain companies or investment funds (i) of which other Tesla directors are founders, significant shareholders,
directors, officers, or managers, and/or (ii) with which Tesla has had certain relationships, such as those set forth in “
Related
Person Transactions
” under this Item 13 above. The Board concluded that none of these investments are material so as to
impede the exercise of independent judgment by any of Messrs. Ehrenpreis, Gebbia, Murdoch or Straubel.
